# Major Project Proposal
What I plan on doing for my mayor project for computer science is to create a game, similar to the Worldâ€™s Hardest Game, where the player needs to evade objects throughout the level. Once you collect points you pass the level. That would be the main idea of the game. The player would be a ball, which moves back and forth (I might add something which allows the player to move up and down ). Each level will get harder and harder, and the enemies will also be balls. These enemies will move faster or get bigger as there are more levels.

## Need to Have List
- A movable character.
- At least three enemies by level
- A score keeping 
- Points to collect to pass level
- 10 levels
- Resizable screen
- Background Music
- Sound Effects

## Nice to Have List
- More than 10 Levels
- Infinite Level
- Inventory
- Power Ups
- Choose your Character (colour)
- Save Progress
